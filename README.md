## 🚀 What is ShortCircuit?

**ShortCircuit** is a centralized, curated repository of **student-built projects**, designed to help learners find the **best hands-on implementations** of core technical concepts — quickly and reliably.

Instead of scattered GitHub links, outdated tutorials, or empty boilerplate repos, ShortCircuit provides:

- ✅ Verified student projects  
- ✅ Concept-wise organization 
- ✅ A single trusted source for learning-by-building  

This repository is **not just a list of links** — it’s a **living knowledge base** actively maintained by Phoenix Club.

## 🎯 Aim & Purpose

- Bridge the gap between **theory and implementation**
- Encourage **quality project building** among students
- Create a **long-term archive** of LNMIIT student work

- Standardize project submissions across domains
